I followed the ['How To Serve Django Applications with Apache and mod_wsgi on Ubuntu 14.04'](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-apache-and-mod_wsgi-on-ubuntu-14-04) tutorial to set up the University at Buffalo server. Note that the UB server is Centos 6 REHL, not Ubuntu 14.04.<br>

Contact Dave Yearke at yearke@buffalo.edu if you need admin / UB server technical support, he is very familiar with the CrowdHydrology work.<br><br>
